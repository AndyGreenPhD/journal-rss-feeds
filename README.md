# RSS feeds for Information Systems and InfoSec academic journals

Keeping an eye on new articles from academic journals can easily be a full-time job.  So, I wanted to find a way to make this easier on myself and others.

Hopefully you will find this repo beneficial to your efforts to stay current on literature in the IS and InfoSec spaces.

I welcome contributions if you would like to help!
